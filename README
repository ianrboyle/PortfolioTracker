TODO:
- CRUD Position
- TESTS for Position
- Set up caching? would require updates every 24 hours
- Unit tests for fmp?
- figure out why GetUserById isn't throwing errors correctly
- address getUserPositions logic... should we even check for user considering when this will only be called when a user is logged in?
